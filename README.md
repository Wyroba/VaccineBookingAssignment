# VaccineBookingAssignment
The first assignment for SYST24444 at Sheridan College.
The project was to use JQuery to take informastion from a user and create an appoint for a vaccine booking. These booking were to be store in localstorage in the browser.
The bookings in the storage were to also be accessible and deleteable.
A working version of this web app was located at: http://wyrobap.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/SYST24444/Assignment1/
